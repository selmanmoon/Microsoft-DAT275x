Machine Learning projects during the course

--------------------------------------------------------------



Challenge 1 Instructions

To complete this challenge:

    Use the Adventure Works Cycles customer data you worked with in challenge 1 to create a classification model that predicts whether or not a customer will purchase a bike. The model should predict bike purchasing for new customers for whom no information about average monthly spend or previous bike purchases is available.
    Download the test data. This data includes customer features but does not include bike purchasing or average monthly spend values.
    Use your model to predict the corresponding test dataset. Don't forget to apply what you've learned throughout this course.
    Go to the next page to check how well your prediction against the actual result.

Challenge 2 Instructions 

To complete this challenge:

    Use the Adventure Works Cycles customer data you worked with in challenge 1 and 2 to create a regression model that predicts a customer's average monthly spend. The model should predict average monthly spend for new customers for whom no information about average monthly spend or previous bike purchases is available.
    Download the test data. This is the same test data that you have used in classification challenge. This data includes customer features but does not include bike purchasing or average monthly spend values.
    Use your model to predict on the corresponding test dataset. Don't forget to apply what you've learned throughout this course.
    Go to the next page to check how well your prediction against the actual result.
